# Welcome!

This is my own personal site to showcase my experience and cool projects. It is intended to be light touch and expandable. You can access the website under the URL: [keston-4.github.io](https://keston-4.github.io).

The stack is Next.JS + TailwindCSS and is deployed using Github Actions as a Github Page.

Strangely, this static website even though Next.JS is not usually used this way. But the intent here is for extensibility, and future use with Vercel (if needed). But for now, this is OK!

## Template

The source template is from the amazing Tailwind UI (see [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com)). They have a plethora of beautiful components and templates which are awesome for projects. This particular template is called "Spotlight" which I have torn apart and cleaned up for this specific use case.
